    " 1.In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be\n",
    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "*\n",
    "&#39;hello&#39;\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "-\n",
    "/\n",
    "+\n",
    "sol. The elements in the list can be categorized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "'hello': String value\n",
    "-87.8: Numeric value\n",
    "-: Mathematical operator (subtraction)\n",
    "/: Mathematical operator (division)\n",
    "+: Mathematical operator (addition)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "sol.  a string is a sequence of characters that represents text, whereas a variable is a named container used to store a value, which can be of various data types including a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a value that is assigned directly to a variable, such as name = \"John Doe\". The value of the string cannot be changed once it has been assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "sol. Numeric Data Types: These are data types that are used to store numerical values, such as integers and floating-point numbers. For example, in Python, the \"int\" data type is used to represent integers, while the \"float\" data type is used to represent floating-point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "String Data Types: These are data types used to store text data, such as names, addresses, and other textual information. For example, in Python, the \"str\" data type is used to represent strings. Strings can be enclosed in single or double quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean Data Types: These are data types used to store a logical value, either \"True\" or \"False\". In many programming languages, including Python, the \"bool\" data type is used to represent Boolean values. Boolean data types are often used in conditional statements and control flow, to determine whether a certain condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "float data types: no. with decimal points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "sol. An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that produces a result. Expressions can be simple or complex, and the specific elements that make up an expression can vary depending on the programming language being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, an expression is made up of values and variables, which represent the data being manipulated, and operators, which specify the operations to be performed on that data. For example, in the expression 2 + 3, the values 2 and 3 are being operated on by the addition operator +.\n",
    "\n",
    "All expressions, regardless of their complexity, evaluate to a single value. This value can be a number, a string, a Boolean value, or an object, depending on the specific data types involved in the expression. Expressions can be used to perform a wide range of operations, such as mathematical calculations, string concatenation, and Boolean operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, an expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that evaluates to a single value, and the specific elements that make up an expression can vary depending on the programming language being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an\n",
    "expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "sol. a statement is an action or command that  orders something. eg: if else, loop etc.\n",
    "     an expression is a combination of values, operators and characters. eg. val a: Int = 5 + 5 #yields 10\n",
    "    \n",
    "6.    6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    " sol. The bacon variable is set to 22.\n",
    "    The bacon + 1 expression does not reassign the value in bacon (that would need an assignment statement: bacon = bacon + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "sol.The bacon variable is The bacon + 1 expression does not reassign the value in bacon (that would need an assignment statement: bacon = bacon + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "&#39;spam&#39; + &#39;spamspam&#39;\n",
    "&#39;spam&#39; * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "sol. The value of 'spam' + 'spamspam' would be 'spamspamspam'. This is because the + operator is used for string concatenation, and not for addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of 'spam' * 3 would be 'spamspamspam'. This is because the * operator is used for repeating a string multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "sol. the name \"eggs\" is a valid variable name because it starts with a letter and only contains letters. On the other hand, the number \n",
    "100 is not a valid variable name because it starts with a number, which is not allowed in most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of value?\n",
    " sol.  To get an integer representation of a value, you can use the int() function.  \n",
    "        float() for float\n",
    "        str  ()for string.\n",
    "        \n",
    "10.   Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "&#39;I have eaten &#39; + 99 + &#39; burritos.&#39;\n",
    "\n",
    " sol. The expression 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.' causes an error because the + operator is left associative, meaning that the expression is evaluated from left to right. In this case, the first + operator is concatenating the string \n",
    "    'I have eaten ' with the number 99, resulting in a type error because you cannot concatenate a string with a number.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To fix this error, you need to convert the number 99 to a string before concatenating it with the other strings. You can do this by using the str() function, like this: 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'.\n",
    "    This will correctly evaluate the expression and produce the string 'I have eaten 99 burritos.'.\n",
